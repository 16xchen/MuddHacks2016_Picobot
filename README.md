# Picobot
Picobot was a project for the Fall 2016 Harvey Mudd Hardware Hackathon Muddhacks which placed in the top 6 out of 65 teams. Picobot is a robot which can navigate a physical environment given a set of rules. It does this by detecting its surroundings with four proximity sensors and moving depending on the inputs given by the sensors.
